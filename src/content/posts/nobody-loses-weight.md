## Project Viking Didn't Start in the Gym
It started on the back of a moped in Vietnam.

I'd booked a Grub — their version of Uber, except instead of a car, it's always a little scooter, a driver in flip-flops, and a helmet two sizes too small. Mine pulled up, cheerful, motioned for me to hop on.

I climbed aboard, and that poor machine sank like a rowboat taking on water. The suspension gave out a groan I can still hear, like the opening note of a sad violin.

The driver froze. I could almost see the calculations running in his head: engine capacity vs. this passenger vs. the laws of physics. He revved anyway — and the bike made a sound I can only describe as a sewing machine being tortured. We wobbled forward, wheezing, every bolt in the frame begging for retirement.

I laughed on the outside. Inside, it was a gut punch.

By the time I got back home, the laughter was gone. The joints hurt, the chest was tight, and for the first time, I admitted something was very wrong.

I was 160 kilograms. And it didn't matter what my friends thought, or what my girlfriend said. No amount of reassurance could change the truth: if I didn't take action, my body was going to give out before my career ever did.

## The GP's Office — The Fork in the Road
I was in my twenties, sitting there while he worked through the motions: weigh-in, blood pressure cuff, blood tests. Clinical efficiency, like he'd seen this all before. When the results came back, he didn't hesitate — he started writing.

Statins. Blood pressure meds. Blood thinners. And a few more for good measure.

He wasn't angry or alarmed. Just practical. Like he was adding me to a conveyor belt of men headed in the same direction. Another case. Another pillbox. Another life prescribed away.

*"If I lost the weight… would I need these?"* I asked.

He barely looked up, then laughed. *"Nobody loses the weight. They try. They plateau. They end up back here. You'll be on these for life."*

I remember staring into his eyes for what felt like the longest moment of my life. This man had just written off my future in a single sentence. Condemned me to a managed decline before I'd even tried to fight.

*Fuck you,* I thought.

I refused the medication. I turned and walked out, rejecting not just his pills but the entire future he'd mapped out for me — a future of surrender disguised as practicality.

That was the moment **Project Viking** was forged.

Why Viking? Because Vikings didn't wait for permission. They didn't accept the world as it was handed to them. They took what they needed, went where others wouldn't go, and built strength not just for show but for survival. They were functional warriors — lean, strong, and built for the long haul.

That's what I needed to become. Not just someone who lost weight, but someone who conquered his own weakness and built something permanent.

## 2018–2020: Blunt Instruments & Brute Force
Walking out of that office, full of defiance, I didn't know where to start. I just knew I wasn't going to be another case on the conveyor belt.

So I did what everyone does — I went online. And that was a mistake.

Everywhere I looked was noise. Paleo, CrossFit, meal plans, YouTube "transformations." Everyone promised a miracle, and everything contradicted everything else. I tried a few things, bounced around, failed, and got nowhere.

The gym? Not for me then. I was too heavy, too self-conscious, and honestly — work was chaos. I was living in airports and boardrooms, running on caffeine and deadlines.

When I reached out to family or friends, the answer was always the same: *"You're fine."* *"You're beautiful."* *"You're just fluffy, cuddly."*

They meant well. But they didn't understand. I wasn't doing this because I hated myself. I was doing this because I wanted to live past 60.

So I stripped it back. If complexity was killing me, the answer was simplicity.

I did what any engineer would do when confronted with a messy, overcomplicated system: strip it down to first principles and plug in something that actually works.

The core principle became: **minimize choices, keep it simple.**

- Keto? No carbs. Simple.  
- Intermittent fasting? Eat between these hours. Simple.  
- Cycling? Get on a bike, ride to work, ride home. Simple.  

I'd eat steak and eggs three nights in a row because it was simple. I'd cycle to work in the rain, trousers stretched tight, because it was direct. No thinking, no debating, no second-guessing. Just rules simple enough to follow no matter how chaotic work got.

For two years, it bloody worked. I went from **160 → 130 kg.** For the first time in my life, the weight was moving in the right direction, and I could feel progress in my bones.

The problems came later.

Because blunt instruments get results, but they also cause damage. My hormones got wrecked. Cortisol climbed. And when the brute force ran out, I slammed headfirst into a wall.

My testosterone plummeted. I started to burn out. And in that fog of stress and exhaustion, I made some very, very bad decisions.

## 2020–2023: The Cortisol Plateau
If 2018–2020 was brute force, 2020–2023 was a stalemate.

Cortisol became the antagonist. In healthy doses, it regulates energy and keeps you sharp. But when it stays elevated, it becomes poison: it locks fat in place, wrecks hormones, and burns you out from the inside.

I was training hard, still cycling, throwing myself into airsoft weekends, trying to outwork the problem. But no matter how much I did, the scale barely shifted. I hovered stubbornly around **120 kg, month after month.**

The toll was everywhere:

- **Energy** — I woke up tired, dragged myself through the day, and crashed hard in the evenings.  
- **Sleep** — Broken, restless, never deep. I'd wake up feeling like I hadn't slept at all.  
- **Recovery** — Soreness lingered for days. Small sessions left me wiped out.  
- **Mood** — Irritable, foggy, impatient. A constant edge of stress I couldn't shake.  
- **Hormones** — My testosterone dropped. Libido, motivation, drive — all blunted.  

It was maddening. I was working but getting nowhere. Every effort felt like throwing fuel into an engine that only coughed smoke back out.

I'd fall asleep at my desk. Pour another drink at night to take the edge off. Push harder in the gym when what my body needed was recovery. Bad decisions piling on top of bad foundations.

That's what unchecked cortisol does: it convinces you the answer is more grind, when really it's the grind that's killing you.

The turning point came when I brought in a nutritionist. For the first time, we stopped chasing hacks and focused on repair: stabilizing my diet, balancing hormones, and pulling me out of the cortisol trap.

It wasn't flashy. The scale didn't suddenly plummet. But we rebuilt the foundation I'd broken in 2018–2020 — and without that reset, the next stage would have been impossible.

## 2023–2025: Project Viking
This is when I found a crew. A small circle of gym fanatics who lived under the barbell. I fell in with them, and for six months we trained together — early, late, whenever the doors were open.

We built habits first, skills second: hip hinge, scapular control, bracing, bar path, tempo, logging every set, respecting rest, walking daily, showing up even when nobody felt like it. They gave me a blueprint, a standard, and a rhythm.

But it wasn't just the lifts. It was the culture.

These guys treated training like clocking into work — non-negotiable, ritualized, part of who you were. If one of us skipped, the others would ask why. If someone pushed a heavy set, the rest were there to spot and cheer. Six months in that environment rewired me. It wasn't about motivation anymore. It was identity.

That culture gave me the backbone to sustain what came next.

From there, I realized two things:

1. My diet had to change to support recovery and muscle while still cutting fat.  
2. I could engineer all of this — with help.  

So I put AI to work and turned the raw materials into a system:

- **Strategy** → Defined the mission: fat loss with muscle retention, evolve into the Muscular Viking and the Functional Warrior.  
- **Training** → Built a 6-day split (chest GVT, back V-taper, shoulders, legs, arms, pump day). AI kept progression strict and triggered deloads before my joints even knew it was time.  
- **Diet** → Four repeatable meals (~3,100 kcal, 225g protein). AI turned meal planning into autopilot — substitutions, grocery lists, calorie balance handled.  
- **Recovery** → Mandated 8 hours of sleep, morning readiness checks, and flagged risks early.  
- **Supplements** → Structured AM/PM stacks for strength, hormones, and recovery. AI even turned them into pill-box checklists.  
- **Data** → Every lift, walk, meal, and weight logged. Rolling 7- and 14-day trends predicted plateaus before they hit.  

In short: I stopped guessing. This wasn't motivation. This was engineering.

Those six months with that crew gave me the culture to sustain it. They built the identity, AI built the system, and together they made progress inevitable. I just had to keep showing up.

## Present Day
Now I'm full steam ahead into Project Viking. Six days a week in the gym, morning calisthenics to get the blood moving, and an hour of walking every day to clear my head. I feel strong and powerful in ways I never imagined when I started. My mental health has leveled up too — sharper, calmer, more resilient.

It doesn't feel like a grind anymore. It feels like a life I actually want to live.

The numbers on paper tell one story, but the day-to-day tells another. I wake up rested instead of groggy. I pull heavy weight and know I'm only getting stronger. Food isn't a battlefield anymore; it's fuel. The long walks have become moving meditations where ideas untangle themselves. And the quiet confidence that comes with being physically capable bleeds into every other part of life — work, relationships, even how I carry myself on the street.

By mid-2025 the scoreboard had flipped:

- **Cholesterol** → Normal  
- **Hypertension** → Gone  
- **Prediabetes** → Gone  
- **Heart-disease risk** → Slashed  
- **Alcohol** → No longer a crutch  
- **Fatigue & pain** → Gone  
- **Weight** → On a clean glide path toward 94 kg at 12–15% body fat  

But this was never about a "before/after photo." It was about turning health from a liability into an asset — proving that the same discipline I once reserved for my career could rebuild my body and my life.

**Project Viking is that framework.** Not a diet. Not a phase. A permanent system.

## The Core Lessons
If I had to distill everything down to what actually matters, it's this:

- **Keep it simple.** Complexity is the enemy of consistency. When decision fatigue kicks in, you'll default to whatever's easiest. Make the easy choice the right choice.  
- **Calories matter.** You can't hack thermodynamics. All the supplements, timing, and biohacking in the world won't overcome eating too much or too little.  
- **Just showing up is half the battle.** Perfect workouts don't exist, but workouts you actually do create results. Show up tired, show up unmotivated, show up anyway.  
- **Consistency beats sophistication.** A basic program you follow for six months will destroy the perfect program you quit after three weeks.  
- **Focus on building habits.** Motivation is a spark that starts the fire. Habits are the fuel that keeps it burning when motivation dies.  
- **Don't do it alone.** Involve friends. Find your crew. The right people won't just support your goals — they'll make them non-negotiable and turn discipline into identity.  

These lessons didn't come easy. They're carved out of years of failure, plateau, and finally breakthrough. But they work because they're simple enough to follow when life gets complicated, and strong enough to build a foundation that lasts.

## Closing
The man who laughed nervously on that moped seven years ago wouldn't recognize the person writing this. That version of me was drowning in his own body, prescribed a future of managed decline, convinced he was powerless to change.

And if I ever climb onto another moped in Vietnam, this time it won't be the rider the suspension has to worry about.

Now I'm back. Sharper. Clearer. Stronger.

This time, it's permanent.
